# semaphore_puzzles
Puzzles I've solved from Allen B. Downey's Little Book of Semaphores

## Repo Structure

The puzzles are contained in folders organized by difficulty rating, following the organization of the textbook. Each puzzle has its own labelled folder containing a C solution and a language-agnostic solution. In the future, I'd like to also add Python solutions.

To run the C solution yourself, enter the puzzle folder and run the following on your command line:
`./build/run_<name_of_puzzle_directory>.c`

## Classical Synchronization Problems (1/5)

These are five classical problems that appear in nearly every operating systems textbook. They are usually presented in terms of real-world problems, so that the statement of the problem is clear and so that students can bring their intuition to bear. For the most part, though, these problems do not happen in the real world, or if they do, the real-world solutions are not much like the kind of synchronization code we are working with. The reason we are interested in these problems is that they are analogous to common problems that operating systems (and some applications) need to solve.
